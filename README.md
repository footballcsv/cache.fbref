# Cache - Football Leagues - Season by Season

A cache for datasets from the football leagues - season by season from various sources.


## Why Cache the Datasets?

### What's unchanged?

The club names get copied  as is incl. typos.


### What's changed?

The league codes get changed to
the football.db "standard" using two letter ISO codes for countries
and if no ISO code exists (e.g. for England, Scotland) than the three letter FIFA codes for countries (e.g. ENG, SCO) get used.

The datasets here use the football.csv "standard", that is, one datafile
per season and league. The league code becomes the file name and the season the
directory name e.g. `2019-20/eng.1.csv` or `2019-20/at.1.csv`
